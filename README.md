There's a fundamental problem with putting System 7 Macintosh files into a git repository. Until I resove this issue, the files you find here will not be useable when transferred to a Mac OS emulator for use with NTK.

For the time being simply download the complete archived files from the [EnRoute for Newton](https://enroute4newton.com) site.
