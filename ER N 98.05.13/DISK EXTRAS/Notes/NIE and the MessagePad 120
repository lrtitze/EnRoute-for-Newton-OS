Notes on using NIE with the MessagePad 120Apple provided a wonderful enabling technology for the Newton platform with the introduction of the Newton Internet Enabler for the MessagePad 130.  That technology is now useable on the MessagePad 120 with the system update file named "MessagePad 120 2.0 (516205)".When using the Newton Internet Enabler (NIE) with a MessagePad 120, it helps to be aware of certain issues.Heap space is an extremely valuable resource when using NIE-aware applications.  Removing all but the most essential Extras Drawer items from the MessagePad 120's internal storage will increase the amount of memory available to NIE and any internet application. It is suggested that you file any non-essential Extras Drawer items on a memory card and remove the card when using NIE.Be patient and forgiving with your NIE-aware application as it is operating under more stringent conditions than most Newton applications.You may experience some slowness as compared to the same app running on a MessagePad 130.  Don't panic if there isn't an immediate response to such actions as tapping a button or dragging a window.  While data is being transferred, your MessagePad is VERY busy and may take a few more seconds to respond to your action than it would at other times.  Often it is simply best to allow any ongoing process to complete before trying to do other things with your MessagePad.There may be times when the MessagePad is simply unable to cope with both NIE and your internet application's memory requirements.  The consequences can range from an error notification to an automatic restart of the MessagePad.  If you experience such problems, you might try limiting the size of the data being transmitted or received through the NIE connection.In a web browser, select the minimal set of display options or limit your browsing to simpler pages whenever possible.With a mail transport, avoid sending large items or send text-only messages, and, if the transport's preferences provide the option, restrict the size of received messages.  Keeping your mail sessions simple can also reduce the chance of encountering low memory problems.  Send-only and receive-only sessions may allow the transport to reduce its memory requirements, especially when the number of messages being transmitted is large.
