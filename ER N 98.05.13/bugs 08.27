-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PROBLEM ID#: 1674160TITLE: -48205 invoked when loading mail without enough storage spaceRESPONSE:The new German text supplied has been added to provide the warning message.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PROBLEM ID#: 1674701TITLE: (-48404) from receiving mail dated later than system date, date filter enabled* REGRESSIONNext day I retrieved same mail (Leave on server enabled) => none marked with futuredate and no throws.Aug 21 1997 8:54AM Sylvia Loebach:I could not reproduce the throw after deleting all pre-existing POP lists and Rule sets.RESPONSE:I was also unable to reproduce this. Looking at the code related to dates, there isno internal test of the current Newton's date setting when messages are received.The filter is only comparing numbers to see which is greater; the date of the messageor the value set by the user in the filter.Please try to reproduce this problem.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PROBLEM ID#: 1675079TITLE: Listpicker in Rules Filter displays rules aren't available, but used in the pastDESCRIPTION:       Aug 20 1997 12:39PM Sylvia Loebach:Listpicker in Message Rules Filter displays rules aren't loaded anymore.User is able to change the rule filter to be applied after the card, that contains therule sets, is ejected.RESPONSE:This is related to the "memory" feature of list pickers. I actually had to doextra work to ensure that this behaved correctly. It is actually a very handyfeature as the card containing the rules can be removed yet the rules are stillavailable when using EnRoute.The "Advanced Features" section of the Rule Editor Help document describes this.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PROBLEM ID#: 1675088TITLE: Changes ignored in Message Signature slip if only edit format, not textDESCRIPTION:       Aug 20 1997 12:54PM Sylvia Loebach:Font and Size changes preferences ignored in Message Signature slip RESPONSE:The original text for the "Message Signature Prefs" checkbox was more explicitthan the current "Append signature" but was changed to simplify the UI.It used to explicitly state "Append signature text to outgoing message text" whichmore accurately described what the signature is.The ascii-text portion of an internet email message does not contain anyformatting information and therefore the font will always be lost when themessage containing the signature is received.The issue of the font displayed in the signature editor is something else.There is no persistent storage (preference) for the changes made to this setting.It will always open using the font set as the default mail viewer font.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PROBLEM ID#: 1675132TITLE: EnRoute Rule Editor: Some rules are not followedDESCRIPTION:        Aug 20 1997 3:28PM David Rarick:Some of the rules that you can create in the EnRoute Rule Editor are not followedwhen you receive mail in the In Box. Conclusion:At this time, it appears that the "Priority" rule and the "Didn't hit any rules" ruleare broken. I have not had time to test all of the rule possibilities yet, and if I findany other errors, I will add the to this bug report.RESPONSE:This report involves 2 different issues:A) The priority filter wasn't working as expected. Investigating this issue led me todiscover that the Eudora desktop emailer's "X-Priority:" header field is being sent as"1 (highest)" while the Rule Filter was testing for "highest" with a value of zero.This bug has been fixed in the 1.4.2FC02 build.NOTE: The Claris emailer does NOT transmit any priority fields when messages are sent.Priority is only a local attribute for most email programs because the RFC specs donot define a standard for the field. It is provided in EnRoute's filters simply becauseso many users are working with other users who communicate via the Eudora emailer.B) The EnRoute user manual is incorrect in one aspect of its description of thebehaviour of filters. In actual fact, messages which do not trigger any rulesare NOT supposed to be read. The filter is used to determine which messages are to bebrought in to the Newton. (to filter out unwanted messages)The "Advanced Features" section of the Rule Editor Help document describes this.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PROBLEM ID#: 1675347TITLE: EnRoute: "Set" button in signature slip should close slipRESPONSE:I've modified the "Set" button to close the slip.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PROBLEM ID#: 1675353TITLE: EnRoute: header information gets screwed up on read messages* DESCRIPTION:Aug 21 1997 11:31AM David Rarick:When EnRoute downloads messages that have already been read, the headers ofevery message after that are messed up.RESPONSE:I was unable to reproduce the behaviour described in the report, however it couldhave been related to an unreported bug which has been fixed in the current version.Stored headers for downloaded (read) messages were losing the first line of text.With certain POP servers, this could have been the "Subject:" line.Please try to reproduce this problem with this new build under same conditionsas when it was reported.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PROBLEM ID#: 1675583TITLE: Can't delete a rule set despite disabling "Filter messages"DESCRIPTION:     Aug 22 1997 11:22AM Sylvia Loebach:Rule sets are still marked as the preference after "Filter messages" is disabled,this seems to be the reason why users can't delete a rule set that had previouslybeen activated.RESPONSE:The rule set preference is now moved into temp store when not active.This will allow rule sets to be deleted if they are inactive.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PROBLEM ID#: 1676457TITLE: Enroute throws -48807 when retreiving messageDESCRIPTION:      Aug 27 1997 11:45AM Robert Sirota:I have subscribe to the southpark email list at comedy central, when I went to getmy message I died in the code below: !!! Exception: evt.ex.fr.intrp;type.ref.frame {errorCode: -48807, symbol: txtFrom}RESPONSE:This one is strange. Within the i-net transport,the only references tothe variable 'txtFrom are:   if not HasSlot ( currRxMsg, 'txtFrom ) then currRxMsg.txtFrom := thisLItem.from;followed immediately by:   if currRxMsg.sender then .... currRxMsg.txtFrom := currRxMsg.txtFrom && currRxMsg.sender;and then later in the same function:   if currRxMsg.txtFrom then ....I'm unable to duplicate this problem but I suspect that it could be caused bya message which arrived with no "From:" field (not impossible, I suppose).I'm adding a better test/set of 'txtFrom in case this was the cause of the problem.The new code will appear as:   if not HasSlot ( currRxMsg, 'txtFrom ) then      currRxMsg.txtFrom := if thisLItem.from then         thisLItem.from else "";Please try to duplicate the bug with this new version. If you can, pleasedump the slot "currRxMsg" to the inspector for me using:  printdepth := 4; printlength := 999;  a := GetRoot().|EnRouteN1:Netstrategy|.enroute;  a.currRxMsg;and then, if you have the energy also dump the following:  a.mailList[a.mailListCtr];--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
