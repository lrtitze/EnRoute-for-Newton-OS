A NOTE REGARDING SMTP ADDRESS QUESTIONS:A number of EnRoute users have reported problems regarding their SMTP host not accepting the name of the user as it is generated by the i-net transport.In the EnRoute i-net manual, we state that users should enter their POP user name as simply "user" rather than "user@pop.domain.com" and that they should place the domain "pop.domain.com" in the POP host field. This will allow i-net to log onto the POP host at "popdomain.com" as "user" and all will work just fine.In effect their low level "from" address is calculated from these two fields as "user@pop.domain.com" by concatenating the two fields.The problem arises when an SMTP session is attempted with these settings when the servers are checking the domain of users sending mail. On such systems, the domain of the POP server may not be known to the SMTP server and the server will respond to the command  "MAIL FROM:<user@pop.domain.com>"with and error message which prevents EnRoute from sending any email.The solution to the problem lies in behavior built into EnRoute i-net which was not documented in the manual.--- SOLUTION -------------------------------------If a fully qualified POP Username is entered into the field in the Owner info as "user@known.domain", the POP server will never see the "@known.domain" portion of the username but the full username WILL be sent to the the SMTP server in the command  "MAIL FROM:<user@known.domain>"This will not affect anything else in the operation of EnRoute i-net as long as all fields are filled in and the Owner Info also has an Internet email address filled in.--------------------------------------------------Here is a transcript of an SMTP session which illustrates how the different pieces of information from the owner info are used:The following Owner info settings were used:Owner First Name:     LeslieOwner Last Name:      TitzeEmail Address:        lrt@otherservice.net  (internet)EnRoute POP UserName: ltitze@known.comEnRoute POP Host:     pop.doodlebop.comEnRoute SMTP Host:    mail.go.netRx:  220 m1.mail.go.net ESMTP Exim 1.80 #5 Thu, 29 Jan 1998 03:07:18 -0500Tx:  HELO [201.151.147.88]Rx:  250 m1.mail.go.net: Hello [201.151.147.88] [201.151.147.88]Tx:  RSETRx:  250 Reset OKTx:  MAIL FROM:<ltitze@known.com>Rx:  250 <ltitze@known.com> is syntactically correctTx:  RCPT TO:<john@earth.ca>Rx:  250 <john@earth.ca> is syntactically correctTx:  DATARx:  354 Enter message, ending with "." on a line by itselfTx:  X-Mailer: EnRoute for Newton, Version 1.4.3a01 DBG     Mime-Version: 1.0 (Generated by EnRoute for Newton)     Date: Thu, 29 Jan 1998 03:05 -0500 (EST)     Subject: Thanks     From: Leslie Titze <lrt@otherservice.net>     To: John Everyman <john@earth.ca>     Content-Type: text/plain; charset="ISO-8859-1"          John,          Thanks for your comments.
