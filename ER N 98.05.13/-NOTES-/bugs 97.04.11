A summary of the results found by your team after running thesetests would be highly appreciated.Please note that the last two bugs (1643804 & 1646310) should be deferredunless you feel strongly about it and the fix is very safe (to be discussedwith Ryan).  As a matter of fact, both are reproducible on the Englishversion of EnRoute currently shipped and shouldn't have a high impact oncustomers.Don't hesitate to contact Ryan or myself if you have any question.Thanks,Yannick1646274 "Attachment Corrupt" dialogue on Eudora/Desktop when sending fromNewton1646672 Rule Editor: decimal number not saved in Bytes field after closingthe rule1643190 (T) EnRoute 1.4a1D:"The Subject for multiple items can't bechanged" needs trans1644778 (T) EnRoute: wrong read of "read" translated1646285 Size Filter: (-48404) when entering number w/ period as decimalseparator1646290 Size Filter: decimal number not saved upon closing/opening size filter1646668 Rule Editor: (-48404) when entering number w/ point as decimalseparator1642016 (VB)(T) EnRoute: E-mail address picker title VB/Routing buttonshould be "Mail"1644839 (VB) EnRoute: several Help files too long, truncated1644952 (E) Rule Editor item not put away although "Put away beamautomatically" checked1644960 After sending mail preference not working => item not filed inspecified folder1645974 (T) EnRoute: Konfig. option "Nur lesen" should be "Nur gelesene Objekte"1645500 1.4.1a6 <D>: Looks like there is 2 spaces in pkg name between"EnRoute" & "Core"1643804 (E) Mail button remains highlighted after converting Ink "Whenmailing Send now"1646310 Size filter: mail not downloaded if number entered without "KB"_____________________________________________________________ Yannick Bertolus                       Newton Systems Group bertolus@newton.apple.com              Apple Computer, Inc. (408) 974-0558                         Fax: (408) 974-8949_____________________________________________________________
