--------------------------------------------PROBLEM ID#: 1666919TITLE: Received mail items should not be put away automaticallyDESCRIPTION:   Jul  7 1997  3:12PM Yannick Bertolus:Currently, certain received mail items are put away automatically.  Thedefault should be not to put away automatically (until we add a pref - see1665623).RESPONSE:I've added the following to the transport's "defaultConfiguration"  // LRT - 97/08/24 8:37 PM  // default to NO AUTO_PUT_AWAY  dontAutoPutAway:	'never,Fresh installs will now have the default set correctly.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------PROBLEM ID#: 1668268TITLE: "There is no Internet Setup" when receive or send mail w/updated NIE 1.0 soupRESPONSE:I removed my test for the existence of a default link ID as it was not required.The message will no longer appear.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------PROBLEM ID#: 1669446TITLE:  (-48205) invoked when receiving mail without enough available storageRESPONSE:Unable to reproduce following indicated steps.At exactly what point during the Rx session was the error message presented?I've now added a preflight which tests for the presence of at least 32768 byteson the default transport store which should clear up this problem.TO-DO:I now need the German text for the following message:noFreeToGoOn:"Free space on \u0022\u^0\u0022\u is too low to proceed safely (less than 32K).\n\nFree up some space by moving or removing data or packages or insert a larger storage card.",--------------------------------------------------------------------------------PROBLEM ID#: 1669881TITLE: Papers containing sketches aren't received in InBox when mailed, text only isRESPONSE:This is occurring because Works will Auto-Putaway items which belong to it, whiletext items remain in the in-box because no app is available to put them away.See ID# 1666919 for further info regarding what may be called a "fix" for this problem.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------PROBLEM ID#: 1669940TITLE: -60512 when connecting if User Name or password missing in NIE setupRESPONSE:I tested this and the message appears to be generated correctly within EnRoute i-net.You can test by using:GetRoot().|EnRouteN1:Netstrategy|:MNotifyError ( -60512 );which is EnRoute's standard error handler.Since the problem report states: "4. Connect to an ISP (I used Netcom) using EnRoute or NetHopper."I assume that this was addressed within NIE and was not an EnRoute problem.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------PROBLEM ID#: 1671591TITLE: ER: Some Plug-ins still sport 1.4.1D labels-- should be 1.4.2DRESPONSE:Version numbers will be updated.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------PROBLEM ID#: 1671711TITLE: (E) EnRoute: Rule Editor items don't show up clearly in FindRESPONSE:Modified so that the Rule Title is now shown instead of the condensed rule.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------PROBLEM ID#: 1671933TITLE: (E) EnRoute: document procedure to schedule auto-receive in helpbookDESCRIPTION:In the "Schedule" slip, enter information regarding when you wantEnRoute i-net to automatically send and receive messages.This text is somewhat misleading; EnRoute will not automatically receivemessages unless the EnRoute preference "After Sending" is set to "ReceiveMail". (See related bug 1643269, where LRT explains that this is documentedin the manual.)The helpbook text should be updated accordingly for both English and German ER.RESPONSE:This will be addressed ASAP by the documentation team.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------PROBLEM ID#: 1673510TITLE: Yogi resets when cancelling an IP connection when receiving mail with iNetRESPONSE:Unable to reproduce. More specific details regarding the stage of the connectprocedure and the connection type would be helpful.If you are able to reliably generate this error, and have the NTK inspectorconnected, it would help to set "BreakOnThrows" and send a stack trace withthe problem report. This would allow me to determine where i-net was when theexception was first generated.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------PROBLEM ID#: 1674160TITLE:  -48205 invoked when loading mail without enough storage spaceRESPONSE:This is similar to the problem reported in #1669446See #1669446 for details.Also unable to reproduce following indicated steps.At exactly what point during the Rx session was the error message presented?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------PROBLEM ID#: 1674544TITLE: Enroute can't handle 8K of textRESPONSE:I was able to create the provided notepad item and could not reproduce the problem.Even under low memory conditions (32K internal), EnRoute did not have difficulty.Please provide further info regarding the stage at which the reset occurred andthe conditions at the time (Mail-Now/Later, apps open, #outBox items etc.)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------PROBLEM ID#: 1674551TITLE: (T) ER: Restoring EnRoute pkgs error message: strange use of "so da§"RESPONSE:I'll need a new German translation fo the text:  The EnRoute Core was removed so the ^0 transport had to be disabled.  Reinstall the EnRoute Core and then tap on the ^0 icon to enable it.The text originally provided to me was:  Der EnRoute Core wurde gelšscht, so da§ der Transport ^0 deaktiviert werden mu§te.  Installieren Sie den EnRoute Core erneut und tippen Sie auf das Symbol ^0, um es zu aktivieren.The phrase "so that" shouldn't be in the translation and should be replacedwith a translation of "therefore".--------------------------------------------------------------------------------PROBLEM ID#: 1674865TITLE: EnRoute Rule Editor: rule entry slip not displaying properlyDESCRIPTION:   Aug 19 1997  3:47PM David Rarick:The EnRoute Rule Editor has a nasty habit of no displaying the rule entryslip for all rules created after the first one.Steps to reproduce:1) Open "EnRoute Rule Editor".2) Create a new rule set (so that you don't muck up any existing ones.3) Tap on the button to create a new rule. )It doesn't really matter whatthe rule is, and you could just as easily tap on the rule button and closethe Rule entry slip.) Close the slip.4) Tap on the button to create another new rule.Expected results:The slip that you saw in step 3 should appear again.Actual results:A new rule appears to be entered in the Rule Set, but the slip does notappear. There is a caret just sitting there in the middle of the screen. Ifyou write some text, the text and it's text entry line will appear. Theslip is actually there, you just can't see it.RESPONSE:Unable to reproduce. Was there perhaps some other software installedwhich might have affected the view ordering or refresh?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
