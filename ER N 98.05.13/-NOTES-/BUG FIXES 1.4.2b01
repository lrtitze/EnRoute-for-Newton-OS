================================================================================PROBLEM ID#: 1663066TITLE: Newton books sent from Newton to desktop can't be downloaded w/ NCU => (-48201)COMMENT from LRT:I'm still unable to reproduce this problem after yet another round of attempts.================================================================================PROBLEM ID#: 1666821TITLE: EnRoute: Incorrect return path formulation in outgoing messagesCOMMENT from LRT:EnRoute does not generate the "Return-path" field. It is created by theSMTP server after it accepts EnRoute's message.EnRoute requires that the full name be used for POP Server and SMTP serveraddresses. The use of local names is not recommended as they can causeproblems when the SMTP server tries to use sendmail to forward the messageto the destination SMTP server.This appears to be what is described in this problem report.Also: The "Return-path" field should not be confused with the "Reply-To" field.Return-path is used by SMTP servers to return responses and is not generallypresented to the user as it very often isn't the sender's true email address.Only the "From:" or "Reply-To" fields are guarenteed to contain a valid useraddress.================================================================================PROBLEM ID#: 1666919TITLE: Received mail items should not be put away automaticallyDESCRIPTION:Jul  7 1997  3:12PM Yannick Bertolus:Currently, certain received mail items are put away automatically.  Thedefault should be not to put away automatically (until we add a pref - see1665623).COMMENT from LRT:I tried created a "Pref" plugin to control the transport's dontAutoPutAwaypreference. It consists of a checkbox with the following code in thevalueChangedScript:	if transport then		transport:SetConfig ( 'dontAutoPutAway,			if viewValue then nil else 'never );This doesn't seem to affect the behavior of the transport as I'd expected.Any suggestions leading to an appropriate soultion to this problem wouldbe greatly appreciated.================================================================================PROBLEM ID#: 1661569TITLE: (T) EnRoute: Printed Rules set shows two lines for CreatedDESCRIPTION:Jun  9 1997  2:30PM Ingrid Orlow:* ER: Printed Rules set shows two lines for Created date* STEPS TO REPRODUCE1.

Tap Receive and select inet Mail.ACTUAL RESULT: dialogue stating that "There is no Internet Setup"COMMENT from LRT:What I do for NIE 1.1 when requested to connect is to check thata default link has been created using the following code. What isthe recommended replacement code to handle the problem describedabove whare "Internet Setup" hasn't actually created a "default"setup yet, but has only converted old ones from NIE 1.1?   if not ( linkID := InetGetDefaultLinkID() ) then      :Notify ( ...
