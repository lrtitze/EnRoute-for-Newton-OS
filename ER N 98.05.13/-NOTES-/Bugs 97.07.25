On my active owner card, I have my email address set to"bierbach@slip.net".Just an hour ago I sent a message from my slip.net account to mynewton.apple.com account and it bounced back to my slip.net account:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Date: Thu, 12 Jun 1997 16:35:56 -0700From: Mail Delivery System <Mailer-Daemon@slip.net>To: bierbach@pop.slip.netSubject: Mail delivery failed: returning message to senderThis message was created automatically by mail delivery software.A message that you sent could not be delivered to all of its recipients.

It should be taking my email address from my owner'scard for my return path.  For example, I have my mail info in Netscape setup as follows:POP User ID: bierbachPOP: pop.slip.netSMTP: newton.apple.comMy Email: bierbach@newton.apple.comMy Reply-To Address: bierbach@newton.apple.comWhen I send a message out from Netscape, my return path is correctly givenin the headers as bierbach@newton.apple.com-- my POP server setting is notused.* REGRESSIONThis bug was also found in English EnRoute 1.4.* WORKAROUNDSet a full hostname (e.g. pop.slip.net) for the POP server-- thisworkaround does not apply, however, if your username@popserver is not avalid or correct return path address.Jul  7 1997 11:49AM Cloned by: Yannick Bertolus* CONFIGURATION:Jun 13 1997  3:38PM Jeremy Bierbach:GM+patch candidateDVT*     DIAGNOSIS:Jul  2 1997  1:45PM Marie-Laure Gobbi:Moved from D/Plan B to D/Yogi.*         STATE: Analyze*    RESOLUTION: Unresolved*  REPRODUCIBLE: Always*     FIX ORDER: 2*      PRIORITY: (3) Has Workaround*        EFFECT: Will Affect User*   CREATE DATE: Jul  7 1997 11:50AM* LAST MODIFIED: Jul  7 1997  3:03PM================================================================================PROBLEM ID#: 1666919TITLE: Received mail items should not be put away automaticallyDESCRIPTION:Jul  7 1997  3:12PM Yannick Bertolus:Currently, certain received mail items are put away automatically.
