Install all the EnRoute packages on the Newton2. Backup the Newton with D/NCU3. After the restart, reconnect to NCU4. Restore the backup just made (choose all ER packages)* RESULTSA message comes up saying that the packages can't be restored (actuallythey can't be restored in that order)-- the sentence uses "so da§" as atranslation for "so that"-- it is a very odd construction.* CONFIGURATION:Aug 18 1997  4:33PM Ingrid Orlow:D-2.1 (D1-006)ER 1.4.2*     DIAGNOSIS:*         STATE: Analyze*    RESOLUTION: Unresolved*  REPRODUCIBLE: Always*     FIX ORDER: 5*      PRIORITY: (4) Cosmetic*        EFFECT: Will Affect User*   CREATE DATE: Aug 18 1997  4:33PM* LAST MODIFIED: Aug 19 1997  3:34PM--------------------------------------------------------------------------------*   PROBLEM ID#: 1674865*         TITLE: EnRoute Rule Editor: rule entry slip not displaying properly*   DESCRIPTION:Aug 19 1997  3:47PM David Rarick:The EnRoute Rule Editor has a nasty habit of no displaying the rule entryslip for all rules created after the first one.Steps to reproduce:1) Open "EnRoute Rule Editor".2) Create a new rule set (so that you don't muck up any existing ones.3) Tap on the button to create a new rule. )It doesn't really matter whatthe rule is, and you could just as easily tap on the rule button and closethe Rule entry slip.) Close the slip.4) Tap on the button to create another new rule.Expected results:The slip that you saw in step 3 should appear again.Actual results:A new rule appears to be entered in the Rule Set, but the slip does notappear. There is a caret just sitting there in the middle of the screen. Ifyou write some text, the text and it's text entry line will appear. Theslip is actually there, you just can't see it.Workaround:Do something to cause the screen to redraw in the location of the slip. Theeasiest method is to open and close the Extras drawer (with "All Icons" and"All Stores" selected). Just make sure the new view is covering the viewfor the rule entry slip. After you close the view you just opened on top ofthe entry slip, the entry slip will appear.* CONFIGURATION:*     DIAGNOSIS:*         STATE: Analyze*    RESOLUTION: Unresolved*  REPRODUCIBLE: Always*     FIX ORDER: 6*      PRIORITY: (3) Has Workaround*        EFFECT: Will Affect User*   CREATE DATE: Aug 19 1997  3:48PM* LAST MODIFIED: Aug 19 1997  3:48PM--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
